# String Theory

A String is a collection of characteres arranged in a specific way. Each letter of a String is labeled by a number (_index_) that represents its position in the String.

> The index of a String starts at 0. This means that the first letter of a String has index 0.

> The index of a String ends one less than the amount of characters in that String.

In the above example, we have a String `"drosera"`. Notice that the first letter of the String (`'d'`) is at index 0.

The last letter of the String (`'a'`) index is one less than the amount of characters in the String. There are `7` characters in the String and the last letter is at index `6` (`7 - 1`).
